# Tony Barnes Portfolio
Built with AngularJS

Please note: This portfolio was built quite some time ago as my first angular app. The code could be 10,000 better, but it's visually nice and has good performance. I will be rebuilding when possible.

##Prerequisites
- [ruby, compass] (http://compass-style.org/install/)
- [node.js] (http://nodejs.org/)
- [grunt] (http://gruntjs.com/)
- [bower] (http://bower.io/)

##Installation
1) Fork a copy to your machine

2) Install the dependancies:

`bower install`

`npm install`

##Running the app
For example...

`grunt serve`

Run unit tests:
`grunt karma:unit`

Run e2e tests:
`grunt test`
