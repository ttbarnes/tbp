# Portfolio site

<a href="http://tonybarnes.me">Live site</a>

Uses React, Redux, ES6, styled-components and more. Started with <a href="https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate">react boilerplate</a>

This was built when I was first learning React. I would do things very differently now :)

`npm install && npm start` for all the things
