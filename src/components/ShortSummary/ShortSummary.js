    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
      As a Lead Developer, I specialise in bespoke web app development -{' '}
      particularly around re-platforming and digital transformation projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have architected, built and maintained a lot of APIs, UIs and databases
      for many different types of industries and products or services.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I{"'"}m not writing code, you{"'"}ll probably find me analysing
      something and figuring out how to tackle and transform opportunities into
      clean and scalable solutions.
    </p>
