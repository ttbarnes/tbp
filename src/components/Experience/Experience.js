    <h2>Over 14 years of experience</h2>

    <p>Currently based in London, I{"'"}ve worked with many top tier companies and teams over the years, ranging from startups, agencies and SMEs to large corporations.</p>

    <p>Always eager to help and learn, I have worked in many different industries such as financial tech, travel, ecommerce, music and many more.</p>

    <p>Notably, I have worked extensively with the UK government and also Trainline (Europe{"'"}s leading train and coach app) during times of rapid expansion/growth.</p>

    <p>I have learnt and continue to learn a lot from these experiences, including what a team (technical or not) could, should and shouldn{"'"}t do.</p>
