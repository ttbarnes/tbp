        <H1>About</H1>
        <p>I am a passionate front end {'/'} javascript {'/'} angular {'/'} full stack JS developer with many ambitions.</p>
        <p>I have a lot of experience with many market sectors such as ecommerce, health, fin-tech, book publishing, mortgage comparison and many more. I have led and grown front end teams - managing both business and development requirements whilst ensuring that clean, scalable solutions are delivered.</p>

I{'\''}ve worked closely with many developers in various environments utilising agile/scrum methodologies. Thriving on the latest technologies, I am constantly improving my skill set. I{'\''}m currently building a new startup idea utilising the MEAN stack. Previously built a {'\''}mini twitter{'\''}. My current venture is React.</p>
